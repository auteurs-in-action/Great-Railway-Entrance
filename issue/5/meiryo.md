1. Agree with the reason, disagree with the claim.
   While governments have some obligations to save culture forms that are considered important or representative, it doesn't necessarily follow that this should be the sole or primary reason for financial support.

2. Historically, cities developed from gathering places where people exchange goods and gradually became the economic and political centers for nearby regions. It is from the start a place where people from different backgrounds and cultures interact, and it is this diversity that furnishes development of urban culture.
   It wouldn't be a big mistake at least to believe that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and new ones generated primarily in cities. Afterall, almost every aspect of what we commonly call modern life has been the product or byproduct of urban culture.

3. But to claim that because of its cultural diversity, cities should have certain forms of priority over rural areas, or major cities over small cities, in terms of public funding is clearly overstating its importance. Government financial support, due to its public nature, should certainly aim to serve the needs of taxpayers. Big cities have better infrastructure, such as public transportation, not because of its culture, but because there are more citizens and more tax revenue, and its citizens need better infrastructure.

4. A government, however, can only do so much in facilitating the development of cities.
   It is certainly true that government economic policies do have a influence on economic development, but the primary drive in most modern countries is the free market. The private sector has shown in numerous cases the agility and flexibility of private businesses as opposed to government projects. We have, of course, all seen the extreme form of government-driven economy in the former USSR.

4. This doesn't mean that government should not be involved in urban economic development at all. The free market certainly has its flaws, and governments should work to counter them. One such problem, supported by much empirical evidence, is that it cannot solve the problem of developmental imbalance.
   If the development of major cities means retardation of smaller cities, or that the development of cities hurts implicitly hurts the economy of rural areas, then governments should find ways to help less developed regions by various means of redistribution, for instance, providing more funding to public schools.

5. Conclusion.
