In any field—business, politics, education, government—those in power should be required to step down after five years.

Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.

1. Disagree with hard limit, but otherwise agree with the statement in principle.

2. Modern society is changing more and more rapidly in than ever before in almost every field, therefore social and political institutes must also change with time, and changing leadership periodically is one way to adapt.
   Every leader has strengths and weaknesses, and it is possible that one man who's perfectly capable in the previous decade can no longer follow be flexible enough to change policies and strategies agilely and adapt to new situations and move in new directions.
      Example: Microsoft, Steve Ballmer.

3. Political leaders are responsible for their constituents, thus their constituents should have the rights to elect a new leader should they consider the incumbent can no longer represent them politically. The statement we are discussing is about strict term limit, among the disadvantages are:
    1. potentially affecting the continuity of the execution of relatively long term social and economic policies
    2. opportunists might appeal to irrational public sentiment and propose short-sighted policies such that when the consequences are present they will no longer be in office and therefore much more difficult to be held accountable.
    3. politicians who have spent more time in leadership positions naturally have more experience and therefore can reasonably be expected to do better in certain areas, and hard term limits if set too short might force them to step down.

4. On the other hand, term limits do address some of the concerns people have for leadership:
    1. In politics, it is generally believed that the longer a person stays in leadership positions, the more likely and more capable that person is of corruption. (example, fracking, donations, and lobbyists)
    2. Politicians who serve for a long time in office may for the sake of vested partizan and personal interests in opposing or supporting certain policies that may hurt the interests of their constituents. (loyalty to party interest and ideology)

4. In conclusion, it is best to strike a balance between short strict term limits and longer soft term limits.
