1. In order to assess the claim, we first have to define what is meant by "forces not of their own making".

2. One possible way of interpretation is in the context of the larger philosophical question of whether "free will" exists, and this claim offers a somewhat negative answer. I agree with the statement in this context.
   There're many arguments that attribute the existence of "free will" to the concept of soul, which of course has never been confirmed or observed, at least not reliably. I believe basing the answer of a philosophical question on a alleged entity which we haven't found any evidence of its existence is not rational, and thus it should not be considered an argument at all.
   But we experience free choice everyday, so in this sense the concept of "free will" is not at all alien to us. In his article "Minds are simply what brains do", Marvin Minsky argued that the belief in a self with free will is due to the fact that we are not fully aware of all our "unconscious lower level processes". In this sense, since biological forces are surely forces not of our own making, the claim is correct.

3. There is also another social interpretation, which centers on the relationship between individuals and their culture. Specifically, how much of an individual's behaviour is determined either implicitly or explicitly by culture, and how much by one's own choice.
   There is no denying that culture shapes people's behaviour, but to say that it determines people behaviour in the sense that a switch controls the running a machine is obviously an exageration. A culture is by and large a shared set of beliefs and values, reinforced by various social activities such as celebrations and public gathering. People immersed in a specific culture are invariably by its values, but a truly independent person should be able to with some introspection actively choose to accept or reject those values.
   The aforementioned claim may be true in earlier times when cross-culture communication is much less frequent, but in today's globalized economy it is increasingly common for people to break free from their own culture.
