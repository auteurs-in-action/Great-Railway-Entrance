Educators should teach facts only after their students have studied the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts.
Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.

1. Depends. The manner of presentation of teaching material should serve pedagogic purposes.
First of all, whether educators should present interpretations or facts first depends on the particular subjects.
Besides, different teachers have different approaches to teaching, and they should have the independence to choose whatever they think is the best.
It is also important to take the level of education into account. For instance, primary schools and universities education have disparate goals to achieve, so we should naturally consider these two cases separately.

2. It is common sense that different subjects require different ways of teaching and learning. It will be inapproapriate to teach science in the same way as drawing.
    1. When teaching a scientific theory, one of the most important objective is to help students understand the motivations behind such theory, or why the scientist(s) involved consider that it is necessary to propose a new theory.
       In this case contrary to the aforementioned recommendation facts should be presented first, and this is I think the most reasonable thing to do. For instance, theory of evolution ... Darwin's trip with the Beagle as an naturalist ...
    2. On the subject of mathematics and perhaps other disciplines that are less empirical or naturalistic, however, a different approach should be adopted.
       Mathematical facts are mostly uninteresting and uninspiring. Although the thinking process of mathematicians is still somewhat esoteric, mathematical learning is almost exclusively about ideas. When teaching the concept of "prime number" for instance, facts such as "five is a prime number" only serve to reinforce the concept, and is otherwise not of particular mathematical interest.

3. The diversity of teaching styles and approaches should also be considered.
   Some teacher may feel that for students to gain a better understanding of "revolution", it is best to first offer historical facts about the French revolution, while others may choose to start with definition and categorization. It is hard to give a definite answer about which approach is better.
   The trend today seems to be to adopt a hybrid approach, as is evident in the case of second language acquisition, where the behaviourist and the rationalist ideas are integrated.

4. Educators in different levels of educational institutes might also different attituted towards such claim.
    In general, it is reasonable to assume that when a person gets higher levels of education, his/her abstract thinking will improve, and consequently will be more receptive of difficult and complicated ideas and concepts. Therefore it is conceivable that the curriculums in universities are less focused on facts, at least in more research oriented universities.
    The sheer volume of human knowledge nowadays privide an essential justification for such trend, for to gain even a schematic understanding of the facts in a subject, for instance the history of France, requires months and years of research effort.

5. Conclusion.
