The human mind will always be superior to machines because machines are only tools of human minds.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.

1. Disagree. Human minds and machines are suited for different type of tasks. Human minds are better at induction and judgement, while machines are perform better in more clearly defined problems and repetitive tasks.

2. In Time Enough for Love, Robert Heinlein wrote that "specialization is for insects", which in many ways summarizes the capacity of human minds. The mind is a incredibly potent device for inductive thinking and making judgement, indeed most of the time we don't even realize its intellectual scope. Take, for instance, the task of driving:
    a. traffic signs
    b. road condition
    c. signals from other drivers
    ...
Any specific tasks mentioned above is not at all trivial for any machine, but can be performed by a capable human with sufficient training.

3. On the other hand, machines are clearly better at clearly defined problems as well as performing tedious and repetitive tasks.
  a. Before the invent of modern computational devices, people had to perform numerical calculations by hand, and since the computational ability of the human mind for numerical calculation is limited, this limited the scale of problems that human can solve. With more and more computational power from machines, it is possible now to solve problems of much larger scale such as weather forecasting.
  b. Assembly line workers ... TBC
